<table>
<tr><th><h3>CONTACT US:</h3></th><th><h3>FINALIZE A VENUE:</h3></th><th><h3>CONFIRM DATE:</h3></th> <th><h3>PUBLICIZE:</h3></th><th><h3>CAMP DAY:</h3></th><th><h3>POST CAMP WORK:</h3></th></tr>
<tr><td> We are there to ensure, you organize a successful blood donation camp. Fill up this form to contact us or send us an email. </td>
<td>We can organize the camp in a college, corporate office and residential area. If you cannot find a properly ventilated location inside the building, we can also help you organize a camp outside in a bus/van.</td>
<td>Finalize a date 2-3 weeks in advance. ?We contact the various blood banks on your behalf and it usually takes 2-4 days ?to finalize the blood bank. After that, ?we should leave 2 weeks time for the publicity of the camp. ?</td>
<td>We need to publicize the camp in all ways possible- online mailing, posters and standees. We have a collection of posters, which will help you out in this process. We can also organize an awareness session if required.</td>
<td>Our volunteers are there before the start to help you out in arranging the venue. They will plan out the decorations such that the donor feels special while donating blood at the camp. There are also certain requirements on camp day such as water, electricity supply, tables, etc., which we will inform you beforehand. </td>
<td>We send out mails to all donors thanking them for donating blood and asking them for the feedback on the camp. Based on that, we judge how successful the camp was and what all needs to be worked upon for future blood donation camps.</td>

<div class="list">
<h4> <p>Which blood bank do we call for the camp? </p></h4>
<p>We only organize blood donation camps with government blood banks. We believe that in the government blood banks/govt. hospitals, majority of the blood is used to help out the underprivileged. It goes in-line with our objective to help those who are in dire need and those who cannot get help by any other means. We finalize the blood bank based on 3 factors: Shortage in blood bank at that time, the distance of the venue from the blood bank and your preference. </p>
